Web-Design-Challenge
- Web-Design-Challenge -

Using HTML5 and BootStrap, I was able to create a website. Using VSC and GitHub.io I was able to write and host my website.
More websites to come. 

Web Design is used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.
Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development.
